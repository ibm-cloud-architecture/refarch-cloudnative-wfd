# Run the What's For Dinner application locally - MicroProfile

The aim of this readme is to show the reader how you can run the Java MicrProfile version of the What's For Dinner application locally on you laptop. We will first run each of the application's components locally on a Liberty server. Afterwards we will containerise each of the application's components and run the entire containerised application locally on your laptop too.
